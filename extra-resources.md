# Advanced Sentence Structure & Phrasing

| Structure / Phrase | Explanation | Source |
|--------------------|-------------|--------|
| how the handful of people working at a handful of technology companies through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today. | Complex sentence structure using a sophisticated noun phrase ("handful of people working at a handful of companies") followed by a modal verb ("will steer") to govern a dependent clause ("what a billion people are thinking"). |  |
| If you swipe over that notification, it schedules you into spending a little bit of time getting sucked into something... | Advanced conditional structure paired with figurative language ("schedules you into") and a phrasal passive ("getting sucked into"). |  |
| The reason it feels like it's sucking us in the way it is is because of this race for attention. | Use of the "The reason... is because" construction for emphasis, often seen in high-level speaking. |  |
| In other words, what they just did is they gave two people something they don't want to lose. | Advanced phrasing for rhetorical connection and emphasis, preceding a definition or explanation. |  |
| what this misses is that in the 1970s, when you were just gossiping on the telephone, there wasn't a hundred engineers on the other side... | Use of the focused noun clause ("What this misses is...") to introduce the central argument or distinction. |  |
| whether you'd want to or not, you actually benefit when there's outrage. | Use of the formal linking phrase "whether... or not" to cover two possibilities. Note the contracted conditional "you'd" (you would). |  |
| It's not just taking away our agency... it's changing the way that we have our conversations, it's changing our democracy... | Use of parallel structure (anaphora with "it's changing...") for rhetorical impact. |  |
| The only form of ethical persuasion that exists is when the goals of the persuader are aligned with the goals of the persuadee. | Highly formal, definitive statement structure using abstract nouns (persuader, persuadee, persuasion). |  |
| It's almost like a new period of human history, like the Enlightenment, but almost a kind of self-aware Enlightenment, that we can be persuaded... | Sophisticated comparative language and complex conceptual framing. |  |
| The most complex challenges in the world require not just us to use our attention individually. They require us to use our attention and coordinate it together. | Contrasting parallel structure ("not just... they require...") highlighting individual vs collective action. |  |
| If we could implant that more nuanced view of human nature in every design, would that be a step forward? | Second Conditional to pose a hypothetical design philosophy shift. |  |
